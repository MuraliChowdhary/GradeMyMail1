AI Agents Now Learn From Experience

Two AI researchers, David Silver and Richard Sutton, describe the start of the Era of Experience in AI, marked by Google DeepMind's AlphaProof, which earned a medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad using reinforcement learning. Unlike models trained on static data, these agents learn through ongoing interaction with their environment, guided by rewards like profit or exam scores. This shift gives AI the ability to pursue long-term goals independently.
